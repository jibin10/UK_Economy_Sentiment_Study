    "## 1. Abstract \n",
    "\n",
    "The global economy is recovering from the recession caused by the covid 19 pandemic. The impact led to one of the heaviest slowdowns in the UK's history. It has come back since 2020, but the marks laid by the recession on people and businesses are unprecedented. This research report is digging into the current UK's economy and trying to find helpful information using exploratory data analysis and machine learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "The research will focus on traditional quality news media and social media for gathering data. The data we collect from both sources cover professional analysis of the situation and public opinion. Data storing, cleaning, analysis and information discovery will be made using python programing language. With a large set of libraries and communities, python is now the first choice language for data science. The research report will be helpful for economists, academia and individuals. The access and usage are limited to non-commercial, personal and academic purposes only."

    "## 2. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The global economy is slowly recovering from the pandemic-induced slowdown. However, many factors prevent the global economy from returning to the pre covid era. The new covid variants and an increase in the cases, lockdowns across many regions, high inflation are some of them. According to World Bank, the global economy has expected to grow 5.6% in 2021/2022 [1]. However, the comeback is uneven between solid economies and developing economies. The US has recovered significantly since 2020/21, and Europe has expected to return to normal by the end of 2022. Other developing nations need 2-3 more years to return to the pre-pandemic numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The UK's economy went down by 9.7% in 2020, one of the most significant drops of all time. The first lockdown caused the heaviest impact, and then the businesses adapted to the new situation, and the economy started to bounce back. The UK's economy has almost returned to the early 2020 figures. The given situation is directly affecting the lives of millions of people. Consider it an important area for research. Any new information that can deduce from the research would be helpful for many people. \n",
    "\n",
    "This research report is an extensive analysis of the current economy of the United Kingdom. Using exploratory data analysis, we are trying to find answers to several questions, extract some interesting facts, potentially valid or invalid information, and reach conclusions at the end. We will use a data processing pipeline that includes acquiring data from distinct sources, cleaning data, visualizing, and analyzing data using data science, natural language techniques and machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this research project, a decision has been made to collect news from different sources to analyse the current economy of the United Kingdom. 15 to 20 years back, people were getting news from cable tv networks and newspapers. Due to the rise in popularity of social media, people slowly shifted away from traditional news media. According to the Pew Research Centre, about half of the American adults get their news from social media often or sometimes [2]. Considering the current trends in people getting news, this report will be using social media and traditional news media to collect data.\n",
    "\n",
    "'Can people trust social media as a source of news' remains a question. It has been discussed in detail in the 'Data' section. However, Twitter data has been actively used for analysis by researchers. There is an interesting study out there by Wayne Xin Zhao et al. [3] comparing Twitter and traditional media. They are focusing on topic modelling between Twitter and the New York Times. We are using a completely different approach. We focus on the UK's current economy and aggregate data from multiple sources to find insights and answers to the questions."

    "## 3. Aims and Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The research reports aim to study and analyse the UK's current economy and bring important information out of it. We will explore selected articles from traditional and quality news media (news portals). The analysis will group the articles based on source and then combine them to find interesting insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, social media posts will be analysed individually and in combination. Then each news media will be compared to social media and try to gather unique information helpful for our stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objectives are to apply for permission to use the news media content, do web scraping to gather data from news portals, create API keys, and collect data from social media. Python's NLTK methods like stemming, tokenisation, lemmatisation will be applied to pre-process data. Different visualisation techniques are used to understand the data and apply machine learning algorithms to extract information out of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Research questions\n",
    "\n",
    "The report's primary focus is trying to find answers to the following research questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the most popular words used in the news articles and social data, given the topic 'Current economy of the UK'?<br>\n",
    "2. What is the general sentiment of the news articles and social data on the topic?<br>\n",
    "3. What do the visualisations of the social and news data show?<br> \n",
    "4. How Reddit upvotes, downvotes and scores can be considered?<br>\n",
    "5. Is there any exciting trend obtained from the data explored?<br>\n",
    "6. Do a comparative investigation on news data vs social data and list the findings<br>\n",
    "7. Apply Jaccard index on the news and social data to find the similarity of content<br>\n",
    "8. Group the news and social data using a clustering machine learning algorithm and list the findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Non goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting any trends from the analysed data is not a goal of this analysis. We will not provide any stock market information or banking and finance information. We will not discuss the medical innovations on covid treatment, vaccines and their impact or any other public health information. It is not an effort to find information to advise the public on any matter directly or indirectly affecting their lives."

    "## 4. Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of this research project is to acquire, clean, visualise and analyse data on UK's current economy and draw conclusions out of it. We use exploratory data analysis techniques to do it. Many studies are released based on news articles and using data from social media. But there are no recent studies out there comparing news articles from different sources and public opinion from social media and trying to find interesting information. That makes the research project more interesting. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use news articles from conventional news media like SKY News, BBC, Guardian and social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit to acquire data. Furthermore, analyse them separately and combine as well. A detailed explanation of the data sources is given under the 'data section'. It explains why this data is appropriate, acquisition techniques and other potential data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps & stages\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps mention what exactly we are doing in the research report.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>1. Gather data</b><br>\n",
    "We will manually select news articles from news portals (SKY News, BBC and The Guardian) and save the URLs in an excel file. Then do web scraping using python's 'BeautifulSoup' library on each page to collect the data. To collect data from Twitter and Reddit, we use the Twitter API v2, and Reddit API. An account is opened on both social media platforms, then created a project and generated secret keys and tokens to establish a connection to the API endpoint. It will enable us to gather data from Twitter and Reddit based on the rate-limiting rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>2. Store data</b><br>\n",
    "The news articles will be initially stored into the python data structure and then written to separate CSV files. We will keep a backup of the CSV files. It will help to retain the data for further analysis easily. So, we do not need to do web scrapping each time and collect articles to read the report.\n",
    "When it comes to social media posts, we do an initial cleaning to remove any emojis and store it in a JSON file. Here also, we keep a backup of the data files for those who need to read the report quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>3. Clean data</b><br>\n",
    "First, we will remove emojis, hashtags and special characters using python libraries like 'emoji', 're'. Then we use Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library to preprocess the data for further exploration. It involves tokenisation, removing stop words, stemming, tagging, lemmatisation Etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>4. Analyse</b><br> \n",
    "The exploratory data analysis method with python is used to analyse the data. First, we will build some visualisations to understand the data and then do sentiment analysis, text classification, K-Means clustering Etc. We will separately analyse news articles and social data and combine them to find interesting information. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>5. Discover</b><br>\n",
    "Discover answers to the research questions and check for interesting or surprising findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What we are not doing?\n",
    "\n",
    "We are not gathering any data from the traditional newspapers available in print. We will not use any tabloid news content for the research. We are limiting the social media to Reddit and Twitter and will not use other platforms like Facebook, Instagram or Pinterest.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are not doing NLTK's TF-IDF techniques to analyse the relevance of the text content. No predictive models will be used to predict any data out of the dataset we are analysing."

    "## 5. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Requirement\n",
    "\n",
    "The research project requires a large scale of data to do any meaningful analysis. Otherwise, the conclusions we draw from data analysis will be primitive or outliers. Based on the scope, we collect about 2000 rows of data each from Twitter and Reddit and 50 articles from SKY News, BBC and The Guardian. Every article or social data has been related to the economy of the UK in the past 30 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Source\n",
    "\n",
    "The report is a comparative study and analysis of news articles and social media data on the UK's current economy. The following sources seem appropriate for the research based on the popularity and topic covered.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>News Media</b><br>\n",
    "According to Ipsos iris (the UKOM endorsed UK standard for online audience measurement) [4], The BBC, The Sun, and The Mirror are the 3 news websites to reach 50% of the UK's population. These are all well-known legacy media companies as well. Based on the research questions,  we need news articles on the UK's current economy released in the last 30 days. The last criteria lead us to consider The Guardian and Sky News.    BBC, The Guardian and Sky News have twenty or above news articles published on the UK's current economy in the last 30 days\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>BBC</b><br>\n",
    "The most popular news website in the UK with 76% reach (36 Million people) per month. BBC extensively covers the UK's economy, and it has around 30 well-written articles available from the last month.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>The Guardian</b><br>\n",
    "The Guardian is the sixth popular news website in the UK with a 37% reach and 18.3m audience in November 2021. The Guardian has excellent coverage of the current economic state of the UK. The Guardian's news articles can contribute very much to the research project.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Sky News</b><br>\n",
    "According to Ipsos iris, Sky News reached 29% of the internet users and 14.6m users. It is the 10th popular news website in the UK. Though the popularity is not at the top levels, the quality of the economic articles is excellent. That makes Sky New one of the three sources for economic news articles for this research project. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Social Media</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Twitter</b><br>\n",
    "Twitter is an excellent source of data from the public conversation for academic researchers. Public data is available on nearly any topic, and there are options to get real-time and historical data. For this project, the best option is to use Twitter API v2's recent search endpoint [5]. The recent search endpoint provides tweets from the last seven days that match the search term. A set of query parameters is available to filter the tweets based on time, the number of results, place, verified account, include/exclude re-tweets Etc. A great tutorial is published in the Twitter developer portal to help the researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Twitter API v2' essential access provides free use of the API for one academic project. The researcher can access up to 500K tweets per month. The rate limits are 450 requests per 15 minutes, and each request can return in up to 100 tweets. It means that sufficient data can be gathered from Twitter using 20 requests from less than 10 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Reddit</b><br>\n",
    "Reddit is a social news aggregation and content rating platform. The members can post text content, links, images and videos, and the members will vote or go down to show their reaction to it. The platform handles a variety of topics, and the posts that get more upvotes will appear at the top of 'subreddit'. Reddit has many of the features of Twitter and possesses some advantages. The subreddit structure makes it easy for researchers to find data and does not have the character limitations of Twitter.\n",
    "The data sources are selected to reflect both public opinion and expert opinion. The data sources cover a good area of the research topic, and we hope to answer the research questions posed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Type & Format of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The news articles will be collected and stored into two columns in a CSV file. The column names are the news title and news article, and the news heading and main content is stored in string format.\n",
    "\n",
    "The social media data will be fetched using python's JSON object and stored as a JSON file. The social posts' author id, time, and text will be saved. The CSV and JSON format data can be quickly loaded to Jupiter notebook using python's panda data frame. Once the data is available in a data frame, we can clean the data and start exploratory data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Potential Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "The other potential sources for news articles are The Sun, Mirror, Mail Online and The Independent. These are all major news websites in the UK. Mail Online has an excellent set of articles on the UK's economy and is very popular with a 45% reach. The number of articles and variety of authors exceeds all of our three selected sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "The other three news websites are highly popular and cover sensational news, personal accounts on the economy. These are good sources for opinion and celebrity news. These articles can get us some additional information for our research.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main disadvantage of all four news sources is their tabloid nature. They use puns and emotive headlines to get the users attention, but the article may lack the background details. They try to sensationalise the news with dramatic coverage and different use of the language. So the reports are not often direct. It raises an issue of reliability and quality. The selection of tabloid news articles may lead to controversial findings and bias against persons or organisations. \n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid the situation mentioned above, we choose to stick with the traditional quality press, which is more factual, direct and provide much more analysis and detail behind each news article.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Bias in the Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "We have selected the news media based on high-quality formal content, topic coverage, and popularity. The bias of the news media can affect our research study. BBC has been known for its neutral reporting for years, Sky news is sometimes right-leaning, and The Guardian is a left-leaning news media. Even more common topics like the economy can be affected by the media's traditional reporting line and bias. We do a combination study to overcome the media bias, the bias of the reporters and news editors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The social media feed is biased, and it depends on the individual. The age, education, demographics, politics, and ethnicity of the person can affect social media posts. People tend to post fake news, emotional or sensational content. Social media companies try to avoid by labelling and filtering content. We rely on a larger sample size and verified social media account to work around this problem."

The combined news headlines have a way lesser SSE value (30.61). It means that the 9 clusters made by the K-Means algorithm have significantly different content between the articles and somewhat similar content in each cluster.\n",
